In order for our project to work on your computer, do the following:

1. Open command prompt in your IDE

2. Activate the virtual environment myenv by pasting this command into your terminal
myenv\Scripts\activate 

*You'll know this worked if your terminal displays a path similar to this*:
(myenv) C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\Blackjack_Game

3. To install the correct packages required to run the game, paste this into your terminal:
pip install -r req.txt

This will pull from the req.txt file located in the game directory you downloaded
This may take a few minutes
Code should now be able to run.
